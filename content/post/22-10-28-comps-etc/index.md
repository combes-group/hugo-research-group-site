If you want Josh on your committee read below.

Because I am a physicist that is not in the physics department I get asked to be on a lot of committees as the external examiner. It can be a scheduling nightmare.

I'm genuinely excited to be on a Comps III or a Thesis Committee. I'm also happy to fill out a when2meet. Here is what I ask of you in return:
- As soon as the date is decided please create a calender event with the appropriate date and time. 
- Shared the event with me. I'm certain many of the other committe members would apreciate this too. (This stops me from booking travel, Seminars, Drs apointments, etc. on that date.)

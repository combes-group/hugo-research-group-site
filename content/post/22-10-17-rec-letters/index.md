Writing a recomendation letter takes time so please check with me to see if I have time to write a letter. Some years I am writting / sumbitting letters for 8 people (undegrads, grads, postdocs, faculty).

If I agree here is what I'd like from you 
- a calender event set for noon one businees day before the rec letter is due ... for each letter
- a upto date CV / resume
- when did we first meet and how
- what do you think are your technical skills / strengths
- have you had any leadership roles ? University clubs, student body

For graduate students there are some additional questions
- what is your teaching / TA experience 
- adminstration experince

If you want a recommendation letter from Josh read below.

Writing a recommendation letter takes time, so please check with me to see if I have time. Some years I am writing and submitting letters for eight people (undergrads, grads, postdocs, faculty) and I will have difficulty finding time for another.

If I agree here is what I'd like from you:
- A calendar event shared with me set for noon one business day before the recommendation letter is due for each letter
- An up-to-date CV or resume
- When we first met and how
- What you think are your technical skills and strengths
- Any leadership roles you have held

For graduate students there are some additional questions:
- Your teaching or TA experience
- Your administration experience

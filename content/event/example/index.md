summary: Bolder Boulder Quantum Workshop
abstract: The 2023 focus is Bosonic Error-Correction and Novel Qubits. This year we're excited to bring together world experts on novel qubits and bosonic error-correcting codes. Since the last BBQ Workshop, we've seen exciting advances in the field of continuous-variable quantum computation and bosonic error correcting codes, both theoretically and experimentally. Similarly, novel ways to encode, manipulate, and correct logical qubits have seen increasing theoretical and experimental attention.

Noah Lordi is currently pursuing his PH.D at University of Colorado, Boulder. He has a background in both physics and mathematics. Prior to joining the Combes group his research was in the area of theoretical and computational fluid dynamics. These days his research interests revolve mostly around bosonic systems. Many of his projects involve making new measurements of bosons and encoding quantum information in bosonic systems.

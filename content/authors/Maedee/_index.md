I am an undergraduate student studying applied mathematics with an emphasis in statistics and data science. I am also obtaining a certificate in engineering leadership. My educational interests simply include math! My educational goals are to expand and apply the math I learn in my courses to interesting and difficult math problems! At CU Boulder, I am a part of the co-ed professional engineering fraternity, Theta Tau, and the club tennis team. During my free time, I enjoy thrifting, photography, cooking, sitcoms, movies, and music. (edited)
